My home automation solution

## Design ‚úèÔ∏è
We we'll be using the following hardware/software:
### _**bc-hq**_ üíª
**intel NUC** running **ubuntu server**, and hosting:
+ **influxdb** (as a docker container)
  + this will record sensors time-series data
+ **mongoDB** (as a docker container)
  + this will record all the configuration parameters that are not meant to be recorded in influxdb (heating temperature, user parameters...)
+ **nginx** (as a docker container)
  + this will host the main UI webpage
  + the access from internet will be done on demand
+ various python modules:
  + **SMS_operator**
    + conversationnal agent interface with the other modules to allow reporting and commands over SMS
      + using **chatterbot** with a dedicated logic adapter: https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/logic/create-a-logic-adapter.html
  + **scheduler**
    + time and calendar reminders using **SMS_operator** and **interphone** modules

### _**bc-interphone**_ üíª
**RPI 2**, that will be:
  + interfacing
    + an **e-paper display** to show various metrics and status data
    + **switches and contraptions** to modify user service configuration parameters (absent, present, night mode...)
  + hosting the **interphone** module
      + plays vocal annoucements generated by the **TTS** module hosted on **_bc-speech_**
### _**ESP_devices**_ üì∂
**ESP8266** & **ESP32** devices running **micropython** to interface multiple sensors.
+ Bootstraping python scripts will be used along with a source code nginx server hosting python scripts with checksums to allow the ESP devices to check and update regularly over the wifi network if needed
